## Current work
### Robot arm documentation:

> Designing: When designing my robot arm, I wanted it to be very flexible, but not unfriendly. I struggled to find a sillohette at first, but I really like the one I have now. It's round and familiar, akin to human proportions, and I thought about how its limbs shapes can be used to benifit its reach instead of just its joints. Theres several points of rotation and extension, allowing it to reach in tall, far away, or tricky spots. I imagine it would work great in a little flower shop :)

> Prototype: I wanted to make sure that the arm could fold up nicely, and wouldn't have extra/hidden geometry. I made joints for the arm segments to attach to, and its difficult to understand how to combine meshes. At first, the robot arm was more round. The fingers have this square rubber tip, so it can use those for flower stems.

> Modeled: While editing the arm, I found a nice edge silhouette that highlighted the center line of the model. It broke up the roundnes, and kept the faces in line with the joints. The hardest part was those joints, removing faces, and combining edge loops. Neither arm had the same count of vertexes on the edge, but I was able to figure out how to seam them together to keep the edge I worked hard to display.

> Texturing: Something I made sure of first, is to rig it before texturing, to be sure my geometry wouldn't need to be changed before UV mapping, incase joints had created problems (especially those more ovular rotator cuffs). UV maps weren't that difficult, just figuring out how to stretch pieces like the base to show all the faces I needed to for those metal rotating cuffs. I changed my plans to have them be green metal, instead of the original copper. I adore how good I got the robot arm to look, and I loved figuring out specular highlights or normal maps for where dirt would build up and branches scraping off the surfacing. The metal itself looks a little dishapen from wear as well.

## Visual directory and Documentation:
### 3D: 
Includes 3D work from Maya, Substance Painter, and Zbrush. I may move Houdini assets here in the future.
- **_2022_spring:** First 3D modeling work. (I have a diner scene that I need to optimize and add)
- **_2023_fall:** First character animation files
- **_2024_spring:** Contains finished projects from current semester
- **_maya_tools:** Mel and Python codes
- **other folders & files:** projects currently being worked on

### to_organize:
currently where misc houdini assets, maya scripts, substance materials, and other files, are stored for now until I figure out how to integrate them.

### I will add unity projects in here later ^-^'

notes: 
- diner scene, integrate HDA's into 3D folder
- add documentation to monoped and personal game (one-sheet + character design)</sub>
